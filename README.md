Malicious URL Detection Project with GPT & VirusTotal 🚀
This project leverages OpenAI's artificial intelligence and VirusTotal's service to analyze URLs and determine if they are malicious or benign. Featuring a Python application integrated with Streamlit, it offers a user-friendly interface for real-time URL analysis.

Features 🌟
Automatic URL Analysis: Instantly analyzes URLs to detect malicious intent using VirusTotal's service.
GPT Integration: Employs advanced language models (like GPT-3.5) to provide a second opinion on the URL's safety.
Streamlit User Interface: A simple, intuitive interface built with Streamlit allowing users to input URLs for analysis.
Automation and Security: Enhances web browsing safety by offering a tool to verify URLs before accessing them.
